// 1st case
// let i = 0;
// while (++i < 5) alert(i);

// 2nd case
// let i = 0;
// while (i++ < 5) alert(i);

// Not the same //

// 1st case // variable i start from 0 then increase by 1 before enter the loop, which means that the input display will stop before 'i' had a chance to display number 5

// 2nd case // variable i also start from 0 but it entered the loop before it's value increase by 1. Therefore the input display will show 1 - 5 respectively.
